 *  
 *  What comes to mind when you think of tech...hmm, we're sure youre thinking of iPhone, 
 *  Alexa, Boston Dynamics robotic dog etc., at least thats what we would have thought of. 
 *  Our point here is, when you look inside this tech...you'll find weird boards with 
 *  components attached to it. This stuff is electronics and we at Techvaler deeply appreciate 
 *  this piece of tech. As the name suggests, we are Tech Enthusiasts who know the Worth and 
 *  Potential of these amazing tech stuff! So, check out our website techvaler.com and Youtube channel: "Techcafe" to find out
